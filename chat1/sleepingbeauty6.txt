Do you want to do a quick Disney trivia?
Yes
What is the only Disney song to win a Grammy Award for Song of the Year?
I don't know
I can give you a clue. It is the song in Aladin when Aladin and Jasmine sing on the magic carpet (4 words)
Speechless
No that is a new song in live movie. It is not it. Guess again... "A whole..."?
A whole new world
Correct! You are an absolute Disney fan! It is the iconic song from Disney’s Aladdin won at the 36th Annual Grammy Awards. The original version from the 1992 film was sung by Lea Salonga and Brad Kane. This was the third duet song sung by a Disney Princess and a Disney Prince. The first was “So This Is Love” sung by Cinderella and Prince Charming. The second was “Once Upon a Dream” sung by Princess Aurora and Prince Philip. “A Whole New World” was sung by Princess Jasmine and by Aladdin (Prince Ali). I am absolutely impressed with your answer.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Correct. Snow White is The classic 1937 Disney film was, not only the first Disney film, but the first American film to have a soundtrack album.

Guess what movie has this quote, "Think of all the joy you will find, when you leave the world behind and bid your cares goodbye. You can fly"
Peter Pan in Peter Pan
Correct! You are absolutely right. Peter Pan is the classic Disney film introduced one of Disney’s most heavily branded characters: Tinker Bell. She is often used as a symbol for the Disney brand and can be seen in the opening credits of many Disney films sprinkling pixie dust over the Disney castle with a wand. However, in the original 1953 film she never had a wand. While rumors have persisted that Marilyn Monroe was the real-life model for Tink, Margaret Kerry was the actual model, and her measurements were 35-25-36. Want some more trivia?
